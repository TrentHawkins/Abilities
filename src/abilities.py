	Counter is used to facilitate the merging of two schemas.

	Example:
		The Dungeons and Dragons standard dict definition={

			13: 1,  # score where cost 1 ends
			15: 2,  # score where cost 2 ends
		} says that starting from ground score 8,the first 5 increments cost 1 point and the next 2 cost 2.
		You can skip a particular cost by repeating the previous score.
		The class then translates it into a dictionary point cost schema={
			8: 0,  # ground score with cost 0
			9: 1,
			10: 2,
			11: 3,
			12: 4,
			13: 5,  # score where cost 1 ends
			14: 7,
			15: 9,  # score where cost 2 ends
		} that we know from the Player's Handbook,which is then used to produce all possible combinations,
		given a cost cutoff. A default cost cutoff is evaluated as half the cost volume defined in the original schema,
